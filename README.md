To access the API

https://0lxx2yid2e.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/dev

Default Parameter:
width   : 200
height  : 200
color   : Red

To use different values for the placeholder API, just add '?' and add the query values

For example, if you want a placeholder image of width 300, height 500 and color as Blue,

https://0lxx2yid2e.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/dev?height=500&width=300&color=BLUE

It's not compulsory to add value to all of the queries, as the attribute will take the default value if no value is provided.
